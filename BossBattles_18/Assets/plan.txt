ALL OK
testing refactored animations and attacks.
dash
attack light
attack strong
block

So what I need now is some AI actions sequence, some way to build AI.
- Distance based
- Angle based

For enemies use AiStack, and AiLogic. Player had UnitController and PlayerControls.
A bit messy, 2 paralel systems, but it's okey. You could move Player controls into 
AiLogic but it's not necessary.

Block recieving.
